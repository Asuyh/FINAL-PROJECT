   <div>
       <h4><b>Introduction</b></h4>
        <p>The Internet is a collection of computers around the world connected to each other via a high speed series of networks. The Internet becomes the main method in exchanging cultures and transferring knowledge between people.<br>
        All connected computers and networks exchange information and use various services. Hence, the Internet is not the World Wide Web (WWW or W3). The World Wide Web (or Web) is just one of the services that the Internet offers to its users although it is the most commonly used service.<br>
        The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks. The Internet carries an unlimited range of information resources and services, such as the inter- linked hypertext documents and applications of the Web, electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.</p><hr>
        <h4><b>Web Technology</b></h4>
        <p>The Web was developed to be a pool of human knowledge, and human culture, which would allow collaborators in remote sites to share their ideas and all aspects of a common project.<br>
        The Web consists of a vast assortment of files and documents that are stored on these computers and written in some form of Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) that tells browsers how to display the information. The computers that store the files are called servers because they can serve requests from many users at the same time. Users access these HTML files and documents via applications called browsers. The main Web concepts are:</p>
        <h5>Webpage</h5>
        <p>The Web page is a space of information on the Internet that presents information about a particular person, business, or organization or cause.<br>
        • The Web consists of files, called Web pages (documents).<br>
        • It is containing links to resources (text, images, audios, videos, and other<br>
        data), throughout the Internet</p>
        <h5>Website</h5>
        <p>Web site can be defined as a collection of web pages which are grouped together and usually connected together in various ways. Often called a "web site" or simply a "site." The web site usually presents information about a particular person, business, organization or cause.<br>
        Generally there are two types of website styles, Static and Dynamic website:<br>
        • <b>A static Website</b> is one that has web pages stored on the server in the same form as the user will view them.<br>
        • <b>A dynamic Website</b> is one that does not have web pages stored on the server
        in the same form as the user will view them. Instead, the web page content changes automatically and/or frequently based on certain criteria. There are two meaning for dynamic website. The first is that the web page code is constructed dynamically, piece by piece. The second one is that the web page content displayed varies based on certain criteria. The criteria may be pre- defined rules or may be based on variable user input.<br><hr>
